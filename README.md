# My Personal Website

## Description

This repository contains the source code for my first basic personal website. It includes an ‘About Me’ page, a ‘Portfolio’ page, and a ‘Contact Me’ page. Please note that this is not a complete website. 

## Motivations

The main objective of this project was to create the foundation of a personal website with a responsive layout by utilising the Bootstrap grid system to ensure consistent appearance and functionality across various viewports. 

## Screenshots 

The following screenshots show the appearance of each webpage viewed from three different devices.
